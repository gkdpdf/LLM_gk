      "## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CRITICAL FOR PRICE QUERIES**: When user asks \"price of X\", ALWAYS search Brand_Name first using LIKE with wildcards\n",
      "2. **Search Pattern**: Use `LOWER(Brand_Name) LIKE LOWER('%search_term%')` for case-insensitive partial matching\n",
      "3. **Fallback Strategy**: Brand_Name first → SKU_ID second → Show available brands if nothing found\n",
      "4. **Use proper column names**: `MRP` not `Price`, `SKU_ID` not `sku_id`\n",
      "5. **Boolean fields**: `is_active` uses 1 (true) and 0 (false)\n",
      "6. **Join relationships**: Use appropriate JOINs when crossing tables\n",
      "7. **Case sensitivity**: Always use LOWER() for text comparisons\n",
      "8. **Date ordering**: Use `ORDER BY created_at DESC` for recent orders\n",
      "\n",
      "## 🔍 **VALIDATION PATTERNS:**\n",
